🌍 This project analyzes global GDP growth data from 1980–2024 to understand long-term economic patterns and how countries respond to major global crises.

📊 The dataset contains annual GDP growth rates by country and is cleaned and reshaped into a time-series format for analysis using Python.

🛠️ Tools used:

pandas & numpy for data cleaning and calculations

matplotlib for visualization

scikit-learn for clustering and PCA

statsmodels for time-series forecasting

📈 What the project does:

Computes long-term growth statistics (average growth, volatility, recession frequency)

Measures impact of major crises (2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 in 2020)

Groups countries into growth regimes using K-Means clustering

Visualizes patterns with PCA and time-series plots

Forecasts short-term GDP growth using ARIMA

💡 Key idea:
Countries do not grow the same way — they fall into different growth regimes such as stable, volatile, and crisis-sensitive economies.

🚀 This project combines economic reasoning with data science techniques to study resilience, volatility, and recovery patterns in a clear and interpretable way.
